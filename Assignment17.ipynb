    "Ans -> MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented NoSQL database system that uses a flexible, JSON-like document model rather than traditional table-based relational database structures. It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data, making it a popular choice for handling big data applications.\n",

    "Q2 -> State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -> MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that is designed for scalability, flexibility, and ease of use. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that it stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which can vary in structure and fields. This makes MongoDB an ideal choice for handling complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is designed to be highly scalable and can easily scale horizontally across multiple servers or data centers. It supports sharding, which is a technique for distributing data across multiple machines, to ensure that large data sets can be handled with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Availability: MongoDB provides automatic failover and replication, which ensures that data is always available, even in the event of a hardware or network failure. It uses a replica set architecture, which ensures that multiple copies of the data are always available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports various types of indexing, including primary, secondary, and compound indexes, to optimize query performance. It also supports text indexes for full-text search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Querying: MongoDB supports a rich query language, including support for range queries, regular expressions, and geospatial queries. It also provides aggregation framework, which allows developers to perform complex queries on large data sets.\n",
